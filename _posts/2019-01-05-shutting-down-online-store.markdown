We've became the first online aquarium store in Sri Lanka and after two months of effort we'd went ahead of changing the idea. Having an online store isn't that easy task as it has more operational heavy. Hence we are looking ahead to re launch the online store with good inventory and faster page loading using PWA approach.

Till that please follow our facebook page, message to us if you need to know anything, specially about the Marine hobby and reef keeping, what products to use and the issues you are facing with marine hobby.

Keep on doing this hobby in a sustainable manner, always think about environment before you purchase a wild caught live stock.
