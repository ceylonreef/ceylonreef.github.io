Lagoon tanks are one kind of tank design some are wanted to get hold of, most of the reefers tend to use lagoon tank design for growing frags and as a holding tank. but you can use lagoon tank design as your primary tank as well. there are many examples you can find on instagram and elsewhere.

The following description for "lagoon" extracted form wikipedia;

A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world.

There are severing advantages of having a lagoon tank, which are;

1. Lagoon tanks are much shallower and will contain less water then usual reef tanks
2. Lagoon tanks will have a specific theme and you can limit the livestocks you add there
