The type of lighting you choose will be based on the type of system you have planned to set up, as well as what kind of livestock you will be keeping in it. If you are not purchasing an aquarium kit or package you will have to select your tank lighting.

Fish-Only Tank Lighting is less expensive while Reef Tank Lighting and Coral Lighting are a bit more involved and pricey. While shopping for lighting, keep in mind that you may want to upgrade your tank from a Fish Only to a reef tank in the future. Buying fixtures which can be retrofitted with more powerful bulbs in the future might be a better buy in the long run.

The lighting products found in Top Power Compact Fluorescent Light Fixtures, Top Fluorescent Aquarium Light Hoods and Top 5 Top Metal Halide Fixtures will give you an idea of what is currently available on the market.

If you are interested in a long (and even short) term money saver, look into the LED Light Fixtures. These sleek, compact and efficient fixtures are now available with reef grade bulbs. You will also find that using a Power Center to control your lights and other electrical equipment will greatly simplify running your new aquarium.
