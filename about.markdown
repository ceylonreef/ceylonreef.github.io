After twenty five years of freshwater hobby, just wanted to try out the saltwater hobby and there is where the Ceylon reef was born.

I am Yoosuf Mohamed, an aquarist, enjoying the aquarium hobby for past 25 years, on 12th of March 2018 kicked started with the saltwater hobby and really enjoying every bit of it and every moment of it.

### What is Ceylon Reef?

Ceylon Reef is a little online store l, magazine and gallery which will showcase random tank photos and beautiful photos around the internet, additionally my intention to start this site is to promote aquaculture in the marine hobby.

### Why aquaculture is best for hobby.

Having aqua-cultured fish, corals and life rock are really great for the hobby. When you get life rock form ocean, it brings unwanted parasites for your tank, for an example you might brining the marine velvet or some ghost crab, which is going to ruin your aquarium in couple of weeks.But using aqua cultured corals, frags and fish will have much higher survivable and thriving rate in the captivity.We will be releasing collection aquaculture frags and designer zoanthids collection. But couple of months will be publishing updates on more aquaculture LPS and SPS types. Which will going to save the reef and help the mature to be in balance.

Lets save the environment and promote aquaculture!
