Once you have decided where you are going to place your new aquarium, you will need to choose a tank that will fit the available space. Fortunately, there will probably be a number of different tank sizes and styles that will work for you.

While you are shopping for your new tank, keep an eye on what equipment (filtration, lighting, etc.) is included. Buying an aquarium package or "kit" can save you a lot of time and money as everything included is designed to fit the tank. For smaller spaces, the Plug n' Play Mini/Nano Aquarium Kits are a quick way to get almost everything you will need to get started. For larger spaces, one of the Top 1-50 Gallon Aquariums might work for you. If you have the space and desire, one of the Showsize Display Aquariums might be just the ticket.

For those who want to design your own tank and save money at the same time, you might want to explore the DIY Aquariums route. Building your own aquarium is remarkably easy to do.

While you are shopping for your new aquarium, keep in mind that you will need something to put it on/in. Many of the packages include an aquarium stand, if not, there are a number of manufactured Aquarium Stands and Cabinets to choose from. Again, if you like building things and save money, one of the DIY Cabinet & Stand projects might work well for you.
